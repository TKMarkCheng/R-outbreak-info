# Accessing the data in outbreak.info's Location Tracker
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
outbreak.info's Location Tracker allows you to explore what lineages are
currently circulating within a particular country, state/province, or U.S. county.
These reports also allow you to compare the prevalence of variants within that
location, including Variants of Concern. Here, we'll show you how to pull the
data from these reports and recreate the
visualizations on the [United States Variant Report](https://outbreak.info/location-reports?loc=USA).

## Before we start...
Import the packages we'll use and provide our GISAID credentials to access the data.
If you don't have a GISAID account, you can [register](https://www.gisaid.org/registration/register/)
for one on their website. It may take a day or two for the account to become active.
```{r pkgs, message = FALSE, results='hide'}
# Package imports
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(outbreakinfo)
```

```{r auth, message = FALSE, results='hide', eval=FALSE}
# Authenticate yourself using your GISAID credentials.
authenticateUser()
```


## What lineages are circulating within the location?
### Accessing the data: prevalence of all circulating lineages in the U.S.
To be able to discover which lineages are currently circulating around the U.S.,
let's grab the prevalence of all the lineages in the U.S. over the past 60 days.
```{r all_lineages_data, results='hide'}
country = "United Kingdom"
usa_60d = getAllLineagesByLocation(location = country, other_threshold = 0.03, nday_threshold = 5, ndays = 60)
```

``` {r all_lineages_exploration1}
# This ends up being a large data frame. Let's take a look at what's inside:
usa_60d %>% glimpse()
```

You can get explanations of each of the variables by looking at the data dictionary (`outbreakinfo::genomicsDataDictionary()`). Let's look at how prevalent each of the different Pango lineages are in the U.S.:
``` {r all_lineages_exploration2}

usa_60d %>%
  filter(lineage != "other") %>%
  group_by(lineage) %>%
  summarise(min_prevalence = min(prevalence_rolling),
            max_prevalence = max(prevalence_rolling)) %>%
  arrange(desc(max_prevalence)) %>%
  kable()
```

### Plotting the breakdown of lineages in the U.S. over time
That gives an idea of what the range of prevalences for the lineages are, but not how they have changed over time. It's easier to see this temporal behavior with a streamgraph
which plots the relative prevalence of all the lineages over time. `plotAllLineagesByLocation` replicates these plots on outbreak.info:
```{r all_lineages_streamgraph}
plotAllLineagesByLocation(country, other_threshold = 0.03, nday_threshold = 5, ndays = 60)
```


### Modifying the parameters to group lineages into the Other category
One thing that pops out is that there's a big group of lineages which are grouped into an "other"
category. As of October 2021, there are over 800 separate Pango lineages which have been found in the U.S. --
way too many to plot . The parameters in `getAllLineagesByLocation` and `plotAllLineagesByLocation` group
the smaller lineages into this "other" category. Let's break down how these parameters work:

- `other_threshold` is the minimum prevalence threshold for the lineage not to be grouped into "other"
- `nday_threshold` is the number of days which that threshold must be met not to be grouped into "other"
- `ndays` is the window before the current date where to look to group lineages into "other"

... so for the example we ran before, we grouped all lineages which did not have a prevalence of at least 3%
(`other_threshold = 0.03`) in at least 5 days (`nday_threshold = 5`) over the last 60 days (`ndays = 60`). If we want to look at more historic data, we can adjust these parameters. Let's change the window to the last year (`ndays = 365`) and find all lineages which had a prevalence of at least 5% (`other_threshold = 0.05`) in 5 days (`nday_threshold = 5`) in that year. We can also make sure certain lineages, like A.1 which was circulating early on in the pandemic, are not grouped into the "other" category by specifying `other_exclude = "a.1"`.

It's easy then to see the trends over the last year -- the North American lineages B.1 and B.1.2 appearing in 2020, the emergence of the California variants (B.1.427/B.1.429/Epsilon) and the New York variant (B.1.526/Iota) in early 2021, the rise of B.1.1.7/Alpha in the Spring of 2021, and Delta (B.1.617.2 + AY-lineages) outcompeting all lineages in summer 2021:
```{r all_lineages_streamgraph_overload}
plotAllLineagesByLocation(country, other_threshold = 0.05, nday_threshold = 5, ndays = 365, other_exclude = "a.1")
```

###  Remember: these are just estimates
One essential thing to note is that while these streamgraphs are great for looking at the breakdown
of lineages within a location over time, they're **rubbish at showing the uncertainty associated with these
estimates**. In particular, the estimates of how much lineage is in a location recently tends to be more
unreliable, just because not as many samples have been sequenced lately. We'll plot that in the next section.
There are also other [sources of bias](https://outbreak.info/situation-reports/caveats) that are harder to estimate, but you should bear in mind when you're looking at any prevalence plots of variants.

## Comparing the prevalence of specific lineages within a location
### Accessing the data: prevalence of particular variants over time in the U.S.
To get a better idea of how uncertain the estimates of variant prevalence are, and also to look at the prevalence of variants that aren't high in prevalence at the moment, we can calculate the prevalence of variants over time with a 95% confidence interval. To view how these data change, we can also use the plotting function `plot` to replicate the visualization on outbreak.info. Let's look at the growth and decline of Alpha / B.1.1.7, Episilon / B.1.427 / B.1.429, Iota / B.1.526, and how Delta/B.1.617.2 overtakes them in the Spring of 2021:
```{r calc_variant_overlay}
# The WHO lineages are a Pango lineage with all its sublineages.
# Using `lookupSublineages`, we can lookup all the sublineages associated with the WHO designated sequence, according to the most recent classifications from the Pango team.
alpha_lineages = lookupSublineages("Alpha", returnQueryString = TRUE)
epsilon_lineages = lookupSublineages("Epsilon", returnQueryString = TRUE)
iota_lineages = lookupSublineages("Iota", returnQueryString = TRUE)
delta_lineages = lookupSublineages("Delta", returnQueryString = TRUE)

# create a label dictionary to rename the lineages by their WHO name:
# If you don't do this, the lineage will be labeled as a really long name of all the Pango lineages like "B.1.617.2 OR AY.1 OR AY.2 ...)"
who_labels = c("Alpha", "Epsilon", "Iota", "Delta")
names(who_labels) = c(alpha_lineages, epsilon_lineages, iota_lineages, delta_lineages)

who_prevalence = getPrevalence(pangolin_lineage = c(alpha_lineages, epsilon_lineages, iota_lineages, delta_lineages), location = country)

who_prevalence %>% glimpse()
```

### Plotting specific variants over time
```{r variant_overlay}
plotPrevalenceOverTime(who_prevalence, labelDictionary = who_labels)
```

### More advanced options: specifying variants that aren't lineages
It's easy to gather the prevalence over time for a specific Pango lineage, or a group of Pango lineages, like the ones that make up WHO Variants of Concern and Interest. You can also look at how a particular **mutation** is increasing or decreasing in prevalence or how a **lineage with a specific mutation(s)** is changing. Here, we'll look at the changes in a particular mutation within Delta (S:Y145H) and compare it's growth with the mutation S:E484K, which is often found in lineages like B.1.351/Beta and P.1/Gamma, and the combination of S:E484K and S:P681H, which is found in P.1.7.
```{r custom_variants}
delta_y145H = getPrevalence(pangolin_lineage = delta_lineages, mutations="S:Y145H", location = country)
e484k = getPrevalence(mutations="S:E484K", location = country)
e484k_p618h = getPrevalence(mutations=c("S:E484K", "S:P681H"), location = country)

df = bind_rows(delta_y145H, e484k, e484k_p618h)

# Come up with nicer labels than all the AY.1 lineages exist today
custom_labels = c("Delta with Y145H", "E484K", "E484K and P681H")
names(custom_labels) = df %>% count(lineage) %>% pull(lineage)
plotPrevalenceOverTime(df, title = "Variant prevalence in the United States", labelDictionary = custom_labels)
```

### A slight variation: comparing Delta prevalence across locations
Instead of comparing the prevalence of variants within a single location, we can also compare the prevalence of one variant across multiple locations. Here, for instance, we plot how the prevalence of all Delta lineages in a few U.S. states has changed over time.
```{r location_overlay}
locations = c( "Missouri", "Kansas", "California", "Louisiana")

delta_by_state = purrr::map_df(locations, function(loc) getPrevalence(pangolin_lineage = delta_lineages, location = loc))


plotPrevalenceOverTime(delta_by_state %>% filter(date > "2021-04-01"), colorVar = "location", title = "Delta prevalence across locations") 
```
